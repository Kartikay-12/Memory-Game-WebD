# Memory-Game-WebD
It is a project I created using HTML , CSS, JavaScript
In this project there is a timer which runs out in 60 secons and we have to score within that timer.
We can select any two images at same time (not more, not less) and it will check if they are same or not and increases score accordingly.
Atlast of the game there is a reset button to play the game all over again.



Thank you!
